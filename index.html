       <pre><bold>Driving Question:</bold>
How much salt is there in the foods we eat regularly and is it healthy?
Connections to the real world. Why is this topic important to me?
Salt is important to maintain bodily functions but consuming too much can cause problems.
Therefore, I am investigating how much salt should be consumed per day and how salty are foods we eat on a regular basis. 
<bold>What I already know:</bold>
•	Chinese takeaway is one of the saltiest foods Australians eat.
•	Salt can cause problems when consuming too much.
•	Salt in a small amount is healthy
•	Salt is beneficial to our health in small amounts daily (we need it to function normally)
<bold>How I plan to find out more about this:</bold>
•	Search online
•	Read food magazines

 
<bold>Information on Salt</bold>
Salt is crucial for life; however, Australians are consuming to much of it.
Salt is commonly known as salt and its scientific name is sodium chloride (NaCI). It is the sodium in sodium chloride that is harmful when consumed in large amounts.
Consuming too much salt over a long period of time can cause your blood pressure to increase which results in higher risk of high blood pressure.
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. 
<bold>How Much Salt is too Much?</bold>
An average Australian consumes nearly double of the amount of sodium needed for good health.
Adult bodies (14 or older) only require 1 to 2 grams of salt (460-920 mg of sodium) daily to function normally.
The recommended maximum salt consumption for adults is 5 grams of salt per day (2000 mg of sodium).

<bold>These sources are very reliable because:</bold>
1.	www.hearfoundation.org.au
is a charity website which the information is focused on the human heart and salt is highly related to human heart illnesses. 
2.	www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au
is a highly reliable website because it is a Victoria government website focused on informing the public about better health.
3.	https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/salt-facts
is also a highly reliable source because it is an Australian government website focusing on informing the public of health recommendations.
<bold>Brainstorm: Product/Exhibition Ideas:</bold>
Use a database to show the information I will be presenting.
<bold>Final Solution</bold> 
I am using a database to enter information of amounts of salt in different foods and other related information.
I will explore many sources for information of salt in different foods. Use website to present template.
